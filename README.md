# Video gallery just like in ZOOM with CSS Houdini ðŸŽ©

![something similar to this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dosant/dosant.github.io/master/zoom-gallery.jpg)

I had to build a video gallery similar to the one ZOOM has for a video-conferencing app. 

I've spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to build it with pure CSS and I... FAILED ðŸ˜•

In the end I solved it with a bit of JavaScript. I documeneted my original solution [here](https://dev.to/antondosov/building-a-video-gallery-just-like-in-zoom-4mam).

Later, for fun, I tried to build it with experimental CSS Layout API. Working result is in this repository.

**To see it an action make sure to enable experimental web platform features in chrome or firefox.**
